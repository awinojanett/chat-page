Voice-Enabled Chat Page with LLM Integration

This project is a browser-based Chat Page that takes voice inputs from users, which are transcribed and processed through a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate human-like responses. It replies via both text and speech, creating a natural and accessible conversation experience.


Features

•	Voice input using the browser's Speech Recognition API

•	AI responses powered by Google Gemini LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash)

•	Text-to-speech output using Web Speech Synthesis API

•	Keyboard support with Enter to send messages and multiline text input


Technologies Used

1. Web Speech API

•	SpeechRecognition: Captures and transcribes voice input into text.

•	SpeechSynthesis: Reads out chatbot responses for a conversational feel.


2. HTML + CSS + JavaScript

•	Pure frontend implementation for handling DOM interaction, chat interface, and user input/output handling.


3. Gemini LLM (Google AI)

•	Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash API to send user messages and receive intelligent responses.

•	Communication is handled via fetch() with POST requests to the API.

How It Works
1.	User speaks into the microphone.
2.	SpeechRecognition API converts the spoken input to text.
3.	The text is sent to Gemini API, which returns a response.
4.	The response is shown in the chat window and read out using SpeechSynthesis.
